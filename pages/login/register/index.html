            <li>What is Routio<br>
            <p>Currently we are still in development and further expanding our web application everyday.<br>We want to give our users the best experience as possible. That's only possible if our users respect our rules.<br>
            We expect that users are always friendly with each other and keep the community a good one where everyone is accepted and were hatred has no place.<br>
            Whenever we see racism, hatred, personal attacks or anything like that we will give you a warning and after 3 warnings your account will be terminated.
            <br><br>Do you feel like someone uses our platform to violate any of these rules you can send us an email at routio@gmail.com.</p>
            <br></li>

            <li>What data will be saved?<br>
            <p>When you first log in with Google your profile picture is saved as well as your name and email adress.<br>
            Then when you synchronize your Strava routes we only sync the latest 200 routes in order to save space on our database.<br>
            Those 200 routes (or less) will be saved under your name with all of their data. Wonder what data this is, feel free to send us an email and we'll provide you with the information of your routes.<br>
            <br>We use data of the routes in order to provide the map and statistics for the routes.<br>
            We use data of your Google profile to show it on the "Shared routes" section of our website.</p>
            <br></li>

            <li>Am I able to remove my account if I'm unhappy about Routio's service?<br>
            <p>Currently that is not possible since we have other tasks to do first, but that will be possible in the future as well as deauthorizing your Strava.<br>
            We expect this option to be available at the start of August 2022</p>
            <br></li>

            <li>What happens if we violate any of the rules?<br>
            <p>We will reach out to you to tell you what rules you violated and give you a warning. If you keep violating our rules your account will be suspended.<br>
            Your data will be kept for 30 more days in order to investigate where needed.</p>
            <br></li>

            <li>I have new ideas for the site, where can I send them?<br>
            <p>If you have new ideas for the site you can reach out to us via mail. Our email adress is routio@gmail.com<br><br>
            Currently we are working on these options:<br>
            - Shared routes<br>
            - Searching route by name<br></p>
            <br></li>
